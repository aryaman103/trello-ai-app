## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Frontend Only**: Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - no backend required
- **Local Storage**: All data persists in browser storage
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Modern UI**: Clean, professional interface with smooth animations

### AI Integration
The AI assistant uses pattern matching and contextual analysis to provide intelligent responses:

- **Natural Language Processing**: Understands user intent from casual conversation
- **Task Extraction**: Automatically identifies task names from user messages
- **Contextual Responses**: Provides relevant suggestions based on current board state
- **Learning Patterns**: Recognizes common task management scenarios

### Data Management
```javascript
// Data Structure Example
{
    boards: [
        {
            id: 'board-1',
            title: 'Project Management',
            lists: [
                {

                    title: 'To Do',
                    cards: [
                        {
